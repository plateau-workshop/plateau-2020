		PLATEAU online edition!
	</div>

<p>
	This year, PLATEAU will be virtual.  Instead of our usual in-person workshop, we’ll ask that authors of accepted papers produce a 12-minute video.  We’ll post the videos to the PLATEAU website about a week before the event, and we’ll ask workshop attendees to view them before the day of the workshop.  The workshop itself will be a video call that includes the authors and all workshop attendees.  The organizers will facilitate discussions on the themes of the accepted papers and the direction that PL + HCI work is taking more broadly.
</p>

<p>
	Paper submission formats remain the same as in prior years.

		PLATEAU Overview

    <div class="no-top-padding">
      <p class="no-top-padding">
      The PLATEAU workshop covers all topics at the intersection of PL and HCI.  It brings together expertise on the usability of programming languages and tools with expertise on how the programming languages toolbox can be used in service of HCI goals.

    What to Submit
    </div>

    <div>
    <p>
    We encourage both standard research papers and more unusual works&#8212;for instance, papers that describe works-in-progress or recently completed work, report on experiences gained, question accepted wisdom, raise challenging open problems, or propose speculative new approaches.
    In short, a PLATEAU submission should describe work or perspectives on which the authors want to receive feedback or which they believe will trigger interesting conversation at the workshop.

    Papers will be published in OASIcs (<a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/oasics/" target="_blank">https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/oasics/</a>) at the authors’ discretion.
