      Programming languages exist to enable programmers to develop software effectively. But programmer effectiveness depends on the usability of the languages and tools with which they develop software. The aim of this workshop is to discuss methods, metrics and techniques for evaluating the usability of languages and language tools. The supposed benefits of languages and tools cover a large space, including making programs easier to read, write, and maintain; allowing programmers to write more flexible and powerful programs; and restricting programs to make them more safe and secure.

    PLATEAU seeks papers from junior researchers who are interested in receiving mentoring from our panel of experts.
    We encourage both standard research papers and more unusual works&#8212;for instance, papers that describe works-in-progress or recently completed work, report on experiences gained, question accepted wisdom, raise challenging open problems, or propose speculative new approaches.
    In short, a PLATEAU submission should describe the work or perspectives on which the author wants to receive expert feedback.
