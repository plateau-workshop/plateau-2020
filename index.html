    <div class="no-top-padding">
      <p class="no-top-padding">
      The PLATEAU workshop covers all topics at the intersection of PL and HCI.  It brings together expertise on the usability of programming languages and tools with expertise on how the programming languages toolbox can be used in service of HCI goals.

    What to Submit
    </div>

    <div>
    <p>
    We encourage both standard research papers and more unusual works&#8212;for instance, papers that describe works-in-progress or recently completed work, report on experiences gained, question accepted wisdom, raise challenging open problems, or propose speculative new approaches.
    In short, a PLATEAU submission should describe work or perspectives on which the authors want to receive feedback or which they believe will trigger interesting conversation at the workshop.
